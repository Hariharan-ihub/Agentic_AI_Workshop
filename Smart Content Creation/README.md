# Agentic AI Content Refinement

This project is a Streamlit web application that simulates a conversation between two AI agents—a Content Creator and a Content Critic—using Google Gemini AI. The Creator drafts technical content on a user-specified topic, and the Critic provides feedback for iterative refinement. The process helps generate high-quality, well-structured, and accurate content.

## Features
- Automated content creation and critique using Gemini AI
- Configurable number of conversation turns
- Markdown output and download option
- User-friendly Streamlit interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [Google Gemini API access](https://ai.google.dev/)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository or download the source code.**
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Set your Google Gemini API key**
   - The API key is currently hardcoded in `app.py` for demonstration. For production, set it as an environment variable and update the code to read from `os.environ`.
2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. **Open your browser** to the local URL provided (usually http://localhost:8501).
4. **Enter a topic** in the sidebar, select the number of conversation turns, and click "Start Simulation".
5. **Review the generated content and feedback.** Download the final refined content as a Markdown file if desired.

## Example
- Enter topic: `Agentic AI`
- Set turns: `3`
- Click **Start Simulation**
- The app will display the conversation and the final refined content.

## Notes
- The app uses the Gemini API via the `google-generativeai` Python package.
- For best results, use a valid API key with sufficient quota.
- The initial content is generated by the AI based on the prompt and topic you provide.
